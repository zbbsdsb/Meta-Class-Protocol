Meta-Class Protocol Manifesto (GitHub Draft)
Project: Meta-Class-Protocol (MCP) A Global Initiative for Universal Metaverse "Meta Classes" 1. Vision We believe the future Metaverse should not be a collection of isolated islands created by closed platforms, but a digital world with unified physical logic and seamless asset mobility. To achieve this, we need more than just a unified 3D file format; we need a standard for defining object behaviors: the "Meta Class" Protocol. 2. What is a "Meta Class"? A Meta Class is the underlying DNA of the digital world. It defines not just "what an object looks like," but "how it reacts in different environments." - Grass: More than just green triangles; it includes wind response functions and growth logic. - Water: More than just a transparent material; it includes buoyancy formulas, fluid dynamics constants, and refractive indices. 3. Core Advantages - Cross-platform Interoperability: Your sword from "World of Warcraft" carries its "cutting" and "hardness" logic into "Decentraland." - Extreme Computational Optimization: Engines only need to identify a "Class ID" to call the best local pre-set physical algorithms. - Semantic World: Enables AI to truly "understand" the virtual environment rather than just seeing a collection of polygons. 4. Initial Draft Taxonomy - Base_Fluid: Defines flow, resistance, and reflection. - Base_Vegetation: Defines growth, sway, and flammability. - Base_RigidBody: Defines mass, friction, and destruction models. - Base_Portal: Defines protocol interfaces for spatial jumps. 5. Join Us This is a bold idea, but great change often starts with madness. We are looking for: - Architects: To refine the class inheritance system. - Physicists/Mathematicians: To extract fundamental physical logic parameters. - 3D Artists: To explore embedding MCP into existing formats like USD or glTF. "Code is the Law of the Metaverse." Let's write the law together.
